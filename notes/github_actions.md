# GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## What is GitHub Actions?
GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline. You can create workflows that build and test every pull request to your repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Workflows
Workflows are automated processes that you set up in your repository to build, test, package, release, or deploy any project on GitHub. They are defined by YAML files in the `.github/workflows` directory.

### 2. Jobs
Jobs are a set of steps that execute on the same runner. Each job runs in its own virtual environment.

### 3. Steps
Steps are individual tasks that can run commands in a job. A step can be either a shell command or an action.

### 4. Actions
Actions are standalone commands that are combined into steps to create a job. You can create your own actions or use actions shared by the GitHub community.

## Implementation in This Project
We'll create a GitHub Actions workflow that:
1. Runs tests on every push and pull request
2. Builds and pushes Docker images
3. Deploys the application

## Example Workflow
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
        
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
        
  build-and-push:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v1
        
      - name: Login to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v1
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_TOKEN }}
          
      - name: Build and push
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
        with:
          context: .
          push: true
          tags: yourusername/compression-tool:latest
```

## Best Practices
1. **Security**:
   - Use secrets for sensitive information
   - Regularly update actions to latest versions
   - Use least privilege principle

2. **Performance**:
   - Cache dependencies
   - Use matrix builds for multiple configurations
   - Parallelize jobs when possible

3. **Maintainability**:
   - Use reusable workflows
   - Document workflow files
   - Keep workflows simple and focused
